# Algorithm for Pick and Place

> 1. Reach Waypoint
> 2. Fetch Lidar Data
> 3. Process Lidar Point Cloud and Image data
> 4. Generate Input from Semantic Map
> 5. Move Robotic Arm Using ROS 2
> 6. Pick and place

For placing the sample first pick the sample from generation and follow an algorithm to calculate the drop point  and move arm accordingly.
