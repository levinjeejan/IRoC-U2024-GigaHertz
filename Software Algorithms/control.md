The algorithm is executed periodically by the onboard computer (Dimensity 9300 MediaTek) to control the processing 
system of the rover and detect any anomalies or failures that might affect the rover’s functionality and performance.
The algorithm also provides feedback to the ground segment and the orbiter about the rover’s status and performance.
The algorithm can be modified or updated by the ground segment or the orbiter according to the mission objectives and requirements.
